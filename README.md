#miscellaneous
These are the extra things written in c and apk file from the previous repo that is the 'app' repository.
this contains 2 .c files
first one is a encryption program .It has five different types of encyption which get selected each time that executed the selection is random.I have included the decryption i think that will be a food for thought for you guys.
The second one is c-program to convert the given data into binary using the binary search algo The data n this case is the characters you can offcourse change it with your data the idea is to convert a digit into binary in c.
so jobless...Those were the days when you thought c is the best.Then u meet python then java but remember "write it c" if u dont get things done.

About the apk file you can download it and run it on your android device.
 
Im done for today will be uploading more repos this year.Bye then
